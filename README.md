This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a small demo to experiment with `react-simple-keyboard`.

Demo goals:

- handles multiple inputs on a single page
- correctly hides/shows keyboard (depending on focus)
- able to be abstracted out to keep form component clean and simple
